# DentaCare — Dental Management System

A self-contained dental clinic management platform with a Flask web portal and a Flutter mobile app. Designed for offline-first operation — the desktop server runs on a local machine and the mobile app syncs data over Wi-Fi, with Bluetooth as a fallback when the network is unavailable. An optional **cloud node** runs the same code in multi-tenant mode, so each clinic's local server can mirror to (and remote devices can reach) a shared server when there's internet — while everything keeps working locally when there isn't.

```

**Backend** — `dental_clinic.py`: single Python file, auto-installs its own dependencies, initialises a SQLite database, and serves both a full web portal and a REST API on `http://0.0.0.0:5000`. The clinic's staff always use their **local** server (works offline); set `CLINIC_CLOUD_MODE=1` (Docker deployment) to run the same file as the shared **cloud node** instead — see [`DEPLOY_CLOUD.md`](DEPLOY_CLOUD.md).

**Mobile** — `clinic_mobile_app/`: Flutter app that keeps its own local SQLite database, writes locally first, then pushes/pulls from the server. Works fully offline; syncs when connectivity returns.

---

## Quick Start

### Desktop server

```bash
# Windows
py dental_clinic.py

# Linux / macOS
python3 dental_clinic.py
```

Dependencies (`Flask`, `Flask-CORS`, `waitress`) are installed automatically on first run. The browser opens at `http://localhost:5000` automatically — which lands on the sign-in page.

**First login:** the web portal requires a staff sign-in. On first run a default account is created — username `admin`, password `admin` — and the console prints a reminder to change it. Either set `CLINIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD` before the first run, or change the password afterwards from **Settings → Account → Change Password**.

### Mobile app

1. Connect the phone to the same local network as the server.
2. Open the app → enter server URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.x:5000`), serial number, and clinic name.
3. The app calls `/api/license/activate`, stores the returned offline token, and is ready to use.

Build the APK:

```bash
cd clinic_mobile_app
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

The compiled APK is also available under `deployment/mobile/android/`.

### Run modes (dev vs. production)

The server picks a mode automatically: **debug** when run from source (`python dental_clinic.py`), **production** when run as the packaged `.exe`. Override with the `CLINIC_DEBUG` env var (`1` = debug, `0` = production).

- **Debug** — Flask's built-in server with the auto-reloader, so code/template edits show up immediately.
- **Production** — served by [`waitress`](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/) (a real multi-threaded WSGI server) instead of the Werkzeug dev server, which holds up far better when several staff browsers and the mobile app hit it at once. `waitress` is installed automatically on first run; if it can't be installed the server still starts on the built-in dev server with a warning.

The SQLite database runs in **WAL mode** (set once in `init_database()`), so readers don't block on the single writer — this is what keeps concurrent web + mobile-sync access from hitting "database is locked".

### Backups

- **Automatic** — in production runs, a background thread writes a timestamped copy of the database (via SQLite's online backup API, so it's a consistent snapshot taken without stopping the server) to a `backups/` folder next to the executable, shortly after startup and then every 6 hours. The most recent 20 copies are kept; older ones are pruned. Files are named `dental_clinic_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.db`. Restore by stopping the server, copying a backup over `dental_clinic.db`, and restarting.
- **Manual** — the dashboard's **Download Backup** button (`GET /api/backup`, login required) downloads the current database on demand.
- Tune with env vars: `CLINIC_BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS` (default `6`; set `0` to disable the automatic loop), `CLINIC_BACKUP_RETENTION` (default `20`).

Other env vars: `CLINIC_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`; set to `0.0.0.0` for LAN access), `CLINIC_PORT` (default `5000`), `CLINIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (first-run admin password), `CLINIC_DATA_DIR` (override where the DB / `uploads/` / `backups/` live — used by the Docker/cloud deployment), `CLINIC_CLOUD_MODE` (run as the cloud node — see below), `CLINIC_CLOUD_URL` + `CLINIC_CLOUD_TOKEN` (point a local server at the cloud node for background sync — usually set via the UI's pairing flow instead), `CLINIC_CLOUD_SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES` (default `15`).

### Cloud node (multi-tenant)

The same `dental_clinic.py`, run with `CLINIC_CLOUD_MODE=1`, becomes a shared **cloud node**: a master registry DB (`cloud_master.db`) tracks clinics, and each clinic gets its own SQLite file (`clinic_<id>.db`). Every `/api/*` request must carry a clinic token (`X-Clinic-Token` header or `?clinic_token=`); a `before_request` hook resolves it and points the per-request DB path at that clinic's file, so the existing handlers run unchanged but see only that tenant's data. The staff web portal isn't served here — clinics keep using their own local server, which mirrors to the cloud in the background when there's internet (see *Cloud sync* below).

- `POST /api/clinics/register` (`{serial_number, clinic_name}` → `{clinic_id, clinic_token, already_registered}`) provisions a clinic — idempotent per serial, no token required.
- Deployment (Docker + Caddy for auto-HTTPS, on a DigitalOcean droplet at `app.dentacare.tech`): see [`DEPLOY_CLOUD.md`](DEPLOY_CLOUD.md) and the [`cloud/`](cloud/) directory.

### Cloud sync (local ⇄ cloud)

When a clinic's local server has a cloud URL + clinic token configured, a background worker thread (modelled on the backups thread — production runs only, not the cloud node) does one pull-then-push cycle against the cloud node every `CLINIC_CLOUD_SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES` (default 15): it pulls an incremental `/api/sync/export?since=…` delta from the cloud and applies it locally, then pushes its own delta to the cloud's `/api/sync/import`. Both directions use the same last-write-wins-by-`updated_at` merge (and tombstones) as device sync, with the clinic token in `X-Clinic-Token`. Sync state — `cloud_url`, `cloud_clinic_token`, `cloud_last_sync_at`, `cloud_last_sync_result`, `cloud_last_pull_at`, `cloud_last_push_at` — is kept in `app_settings`. A failed round (offline, etc.) is just recorded, never fatal; env vars `CLINIC_CLOUD_URL` / `CLINIC_CLOUD_TOKEN` override the stored values.

Staff manage it from **Settings → Cloud Sync**: enter the cloud URL + serial and **Pair with cloud** (calls `/api/clinics/register` on the cloud, stores the returned token, runs an immediate first sync), then **Sync now** / **Unpair**. The dashboard shows a small "☁️ Synced …" / "Cloud sync: off" / "⚠️ Cloud sync error" badge. API: `POST /api/cloud/pair` · `GET /api/cloud/status` · `POST /api/cloud/sync-now` · `POST /api/cloud/unpair` (local server only; the cloud node returns `400`).

### Sync model

The mobile app and the local↔cloud mirror reconcile with the server through two endpoints:

- `GET /api/sync/export` — returns the synced tables. Pass `?since=<ISO timestamp>` to get only rows changed after that point (an incremental delta); without it you get a full snapshot. The response also carries a `tombstones` list — `{table_name, row_id, deleted_at}` entries recording rows that were deleted.
- `POST /api/sync/import` — accepts the same shape (`tables` + `tombstones`). Rows are merged **last-write-wins by `updated_at`**; an incoming row that's older than the local copy is skipped. Tombstones propagate deletions the same way: a deletion only takes effect if it's newer than the local row's last update, and a stale row push won't resurrect something that was already deleted (the deletion is remembered in the `sync_tombstones` table).

Both endpoints require a paired-device token (`X-Device-Token` header or `device_token` query param).

---

## Branding & Configuration

### Backend

Static branding is defined in one place near the top of `dental_clinic.py`:

```python
CLINIC_CONFIG = {
    'SYSTEM_NAME':    'DentaCare',
    'CLINIC_NAME':    'Dental Management System',
    'DOCTOR_NAME':    'Dr. Wasfy Barzaq',
    'DOCTOR_NAME_AR': 'د. وصفي برزق',
    'CLINIC_TAGLINE': 'Patient Care & Practice Management',
}
```

These are injected as Jinja2 variables into the HTML template at startup. The doctor name can also be changed at runtime directly from the header UI — the new value is persisted to the `app_settings` table in the database and takes effect immediately without restarting.

### Mobile app

```dart
// clinic_mobile_app/lib/config/app_config.dart
class AppBranding {
  static const String systemName  = 'DentaCare';
  static const String clinicName  = 'Dental Management System';
  static const String doctorName  = 'Dr. Wasfy Barzaq';
  static const String tagline     = 'Patient Care & Practice Management';
  static const String appVersion  = '1.0.0';
}
```

## Features

### Patient Management
- Add, edit, and delete patients with full profile (name, DOB, phone, email, address, medical history)
- Date of birth picker with Day / Month / Year dropdowns
- Duplicate detection — warns on matching name or phone number before saving, without blocking
- Follow-up sheet per patient: treatment procedure, tooth number, price, **discount**, lab expense, payment, running balance
- Running balance correctly accounts for discounts in cumulative calculation
- Patient credit balance tracking
- Medical image uploads (X-rays, photos)

### Appointments
- Schedule, confirm, cancel, and complete appointments
- Calendar view with week/month navigation
- Status dropdown (Scheduled / Confirmed / Cancelled / Completed) fully translated in EN and AR
- Convert appointment directly to a visit

### Financial
- **Expenses**: categorised clinic expenses with paid / postponed status; negative amounts rejected
- **Summary report**: total revenue, expenses (paid + postponed), profit, clinic gross profit, lab expenses
- **Weekly / range report**: revenue, expenses, profit, patient count for any date range; no duplicate response keys
- **Receivables report**: outstanding balances per patient, correctly subtracting discounts from what is owed
- Billing records with discount, balance due, and payment status

### Header & UI
- Modern glass-morphism header with gradient background, sheen overlay, and accent bottom line
- Doctor name badge is clickable — opens an inline popover to edit the EN and AR name live, saved to DB
- Theme toggle (light / dark mode) persisted to localStorage
- Language toggle (English / Arabic RTL) persisted to localStorage
- **Logout** link in the header; **Settings → Account** lets the signed-in user change their password
- Appointment status choices remain visible in both languages

### Access Control & Security
- The web portal (`/`), printable invoices (`/invoice/<id>`), and the database backup download (`/api/backup`) require a logged-in staff session — anonymous browsers are redirected to a sign-in page
- Credentials live in a `users` table; passwords are stored as salted hashes (`werkzeug.security`). A default `admin` / `admin` account is seeded on first run (override with `CLINIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD`; change it from the UI)
- Session secret is generated once and persisted in `app_settings`, so logins survive restarts
- Invoice output is HTML-escaped: patient names, payment method/status, invoice numbers, treatment descriptions and the doctor name are escaped both in the server-rendered `/invoice/<id>` page and in the client-side "total invoice" print template, so a crafted patient name can't inject markup or script. The `?lang=` parameter on `/invoice/<id>` is normalised to `en`/`ar` rather than reflected verbatim
- Scope note: the data/sync REST API (`/api/patients`, `/api/appointments`, `/api/sync/*`, `/api/license/*`, …) is intentionally **not** behind the staff session so the offline-first mobile app keeps working unchanged. For a hardened deployment, keep the server bound to the LAN you trust (or behind a reverse proxy with auth), and treat that network as the security boundary for the API

### Internationalisation
- Full English and Arabic (RTL) support throughout the web portal
- Translation keys live in the `translations` JS object inside `dental_clinic.py`
- The Flutter app exposes a language toggle in Settings (EN / ع) via `app_state.dart`

| GET | `/downloads/ios` | iOS instructions |
| GET / POST | `/api/mobile/download-links` | Manage download links |

---

## Licensing

Serials are generated with `serial_generator.py`:

```bash
python3 serial_generator.py          # interactive
python3 serial_generator.py --batch 50 --output batch_serials.csv
```

Offline tokens are HMAC-SHA256 signed. The mobile app can verify a token without reaching the server, so it works entirely air-gapped once activated.

---

## Tests

```bash
cd clinic/
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

39 tests across six suites: appointment API, appointment flow, date utilities, sync tombstones (delta export + deletion propagation), cloud mode (multi-tenant routing, registration, tenant isolation), and the local ⇄ cloud background sync round-trip.

Financial logic can be verified with the dedicated QA script (requires the server to be running):

```bash
python qa_financial_test.py
```

Covers 10 test blocks: summary math, weekly range math, Saturday edge case, receivables discount correctness, follow-up running balance, billing records, expenses, edge cases, monthly range, and cross-report consistency.

### Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push to `main`/`develop` and on pull requests: it installs `requirements.txt`, syntax-checks `dental_clinic.py` (`py_compile`), and runs `pytest tests/` against Python 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12.

---

## Packaging (Windows executable)

```bash
pyinstaller DentalClinicApp.spec
# Output: dist/DentaCare.exe
```

The `.spec` file bundles `dental_clinic.py` and `DentaCare.PNG` into a single portable `.exe` — no Python installation required on the target machine. The SQLite database, `uploads/` and `backups/` are created at runtime next to the executable. The `hiddenimports` list includes `waitress`, `markupsafe`, and `werkzeug.security`, which the auth / production-server code relies on; keep them there if you regenerate the spec. When frozen, the app defaults to production mode (waitress + automatic backups).
